# Motivation
The Library of Babel is a book by Jorge Luis Borges who conceived the idea of a universe in the form of a library containing every possible book of 410 pages that could ever be written. That is everything that has and ever will be written appears in the library. Most of the library is a bunch of gibberish, containing every possible ordering of characters to fill every book. Thus, the library is useless if you walk through its endless halls, the chances of you picking a useful book are slim.

# Problem Statement
Much like the casual wanderer of the Library of Babel, the answers I receive from ChatGPT are gibberish. Every time I use an LLM, I usually prompt, and just copy + paste whatever response spits back at me without understanding what I’m looking at. While I love not to do anything, I also don’t want to be a cat that randomly bops keys on a keyboard until I’ve accidentally written the declaration of independence. I want a better way to learn what I’m doing and still get the assistance I need for things I have learned, but do not remember.
Can I create a Retrieval Augmented Generation Assistant that uses well-formed notes I have written to generate responses? Perhaps it might also limit usage of specific topics until I have ‘Unlocked’ them, demonstrating enough ability in a topic before letting me ‘free play’ mode with information in a specific domain.
